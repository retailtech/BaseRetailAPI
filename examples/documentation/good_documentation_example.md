# Documentation we like

Warning : this section is subjective

## [Gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/README.html)

Gitlab is, for my point of view, one of the best documentation. Everything is easily accessible, and the part you are interested in is fast to read, but yet has enough information to help you doing what you want.
The design is simple, focused on understanding. The colors are light, the font easy to read... Well, it's markdown, so it's simple but it works.

## [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/)

The Facebook documentation is good if you have a lot of features. The separation between product and SDK is also interesting as it gives you . It's just hard to begin with, as you can be easily lost in so many pages.

## [YouTube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/)

The YouTube documentation is a good example of the google documentation. When you are on a reference page, you have a fast access on the left, the bread crumbs on the top, and the content of the page on the right.

## [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)

It's so basic and simple that everything can be accessible almost without scrolling, and yet stay readable. Warning through : It just don't fit big APIs.

## [Segment](https://segment.com/docs/)

Segment is clear, clean and easily readable. It doesn't take the normal naming convention (references for calls), and favorites a separation by role (sending and receiving), limiting the left menu (you have everything in one place without groups like SDK), but it's just one of the best example of readability.
